Ruling: better

| Seat | Vote |
|---|---|
| Mid A | better |
| Inherited architect | better |

Mid A, decided by:

- `src/markdown/portable/task-ids.ts:7` `mintTaskIds`: one walk, no carried set filled by the parser as a side effect
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:26` `Reading`: plain data, `codeBlockNode` no longer mutates `carried`
- `src/markdown/portable/conventions.ts:8` `flavourClaims`: one table states what each reader claims; branches name the claim they test
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:161` `quoteNode`: the title is read in the reader's own flavour, no hop through `inlineLeaves`
- `src/index.ts:5` exports: each call named by its flavour; "plain" no longer means two things

Inherited architect, decided by:

- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:26` `Reading`: the hidden `carried` set and the retrying `mintTaskIds` are gone
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:161` `quoteNode`: parser and emitter no longer correct only together
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:113` `readBlock`: branches name the claim (`claims.alerts`, `claims.taskMarkers`)
- `src/index.ts:5` exports: flavour names say which file to open
- `src/markdown/portable/conventions.ts:3` `flavourClaims`: cost, all three flavours' rows live under `portable/`

Mid A, decided by:

- `src/markdown/portable/conventions.ts:8` `flavourClaims`: one table says what each flavour reads; every gate reads a named field
- `src/markdown/portable/task-ids.ts:7` `mintTaskIds`: one pass, no carried set crossing modules
- `src/index.ts:5` exports: each name says which markdown it means
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:161` `quoteNode`: no reach into the portable writer's reduction
- `src/markdown/portable/conventions.ts:20` `ReadClaims`: cost, `directiveNode` leans on a type in another file

Inherited architect, decided by:

- `src/markdown/portable/task-ids.ts:6` `mintTaskIds`: the retry loop and the parser-filled set are gone
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:26` `Reading`: no hidden state; branches name the feature they gate
- `src/markdown/portable/conventions.ts:8` `flavourClaims`: cost, the table for all three flavours lives under `portable/`
- `src/markdown/emit/line-escaping.ts:92` `escapeClaims`: directive escaping under the flag the parser checks
- `src/markdown/emit/adf-to-markdown.ts:146` `spellPortableBlock`: no hard-coded lossless title

Ruling: better

| Seat | Vote |
|---|---|
| Mid A | better |
| Inherited architect | better |

Mid A, decided by:

- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:23` `MarkerParagraph`: the block kind says a marker's paragraph holds no lone image, where `readMarked` scanned its output afterwards
- `src/markdown/emit/image.ts:7` `tryImage`: builds what the reader would build and compares, where `imageShape` restated the shape by hand
- `src/markdown/parse/inline-content.ts:25` `InlineContent`: one rule replaces five image refusal sites over two files
- `src/markdown/external-image.ts:4` `centeredImage`: one builder for the shape three literals held
- `src/markdown/parse/inline-content.ts:550` `pieceNodes`: costs more — its image arm relies on `assemble` having linked every top-level image

Inherited architect, decided by:

- `src/markdown/external-image.ts:4` `centeredImage`: the image's ADF shape is defined once for reader, emitter and portable reducer
- `src/markdown/parse/markdown-to-adf.ts:23` `MarkerParagraph`: replaces `readMarked`'s after-the-fact search and its caller-computed flag
- `src/result.ts:1` `ConvertErrorCode`: `unmappable-image` and its refusal paths are gone
- `src/markdown/parse/inline-content.ts:43` `Image`: costs more — four functions must agree on the image's `link`
- `src/markdown/parse/inline-content.ts:26` `InlineContent`: costs more — no longer image xor nodes
